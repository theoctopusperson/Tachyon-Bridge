Before I continue to deploy, I want to make a change. I'd like to add the ability for the "player" to send messages to the forum. We can give them a known (visible to all races) identity which is an organisation similar to the un but with no real mitiary or politcal power. the objective of the organisation should be to facilitate dialog between nations. The mandate should be to remain objective and to accept all races for what they are, but to serve as a council which can condemn, support or comment on actions that races take. It cannot take any direct action itself, but the player can obviously choose to ignore the mandate to see what happens and try to play the races against each other. 



I'd like to introduce a new feature that will make this less of a simulator and more of an interactive experience or game. 

essentially, I want the user or "player" to be another one of the races. but the player will be in a very specific startint situation. 

The player is essentially house atreides from the Dune story, in control of a planet which produces a resource that all other races want for their own reasons. The reasons don't really matter for this mechanic to work, but imagine militaristic races want it to create supersoldiers, science focussed races want it to unlock new discoveries by super-powering their minds etc. 

The planet that the player controls should only be able to produce a finite amount of XXX each month, and it is up to them to manage trading (or not) XXX. if their balance reaches 0, it is game over. 

The other races should be actively trying to secure as much XXX as possible by whatever means are allowed or prompted by their culture. So for example, aggressive warring nations should consider just invading and taking it for themselves, but in this case, otherwise peaceful nations would consider forming alliances against the aggressive nation in order to prevent them from controlling the supply of XXX. 

The player will be forced to trade the XXX in order to fund its production and the security of the planet. They do not have a native military and depend entirely on milita forces who leave the planet if they cannot be paid. Therefore, the player can dedicate more resources to security which adds to the player's Security, or they need to form alliances or defensive pacts with other nations who are willing to controbute Security
